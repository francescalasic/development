                        <p>My journey has allowed me to better understand how to balance creativity and functionality in design. I learned that a good project must not only be aesthetically pleasing but also meet user needs. It is essential that the design is useful and addresses specific needs. The aesthetic aspect must be closely tied to functionality and practicality, and I reflected on how good visual design can enhance the user experience.</p>
                        <p>In Project 1, I designed and created the children's game manual. I chose a minimalist graphic style with stylized characters to direct attention to the described action.

                        <p>I learned that creativity and innovation must be supported by math and physics to guide design decisions...</p>

                    <div class="competency-details">
                        <p>For me, design was primarily linked to creativity and the designerâ€™s personal vision regarding the shape of objects. However, I realized that creativity and innovation must be supported by knowledge of mathematics and physics, which guide the designer in making informed choices. For example, I learned that my attention to using environmentally sustainable materials must be accompanied by a careful study of the physical properties and performance of those materials. This approach led me to reflect on how physics and mathematics can help me make more informed decisions about the materials to use in my projects.</p>
                        <p>Geometry, in particular, played a crucial role in designing the game box for Project 1, where every element had to be calibrated to ensure aesthetics, functionality, and practicality. The box had to accommodate the device and accessories in an organized and secure manner while maintaining an appealing and child-friendly design. I used geometric shapes like rectangles with rounded corners to optimize space, ensuring that objects remained fixed and safe, avoiding damage or unwanted movement. The design of the internal spaces was guided by geometric principles, resulting in a functional and aesthetically pleasing design.</p>
                        <p>When designing the wearable prototype for Project 1, I applied physical principles to ensure it was ergonomic and functional for children, taking into account the forces of movement.</p>

                        <p>Technological skills are fundamental for transforming design ideas into concrete solutions. I learned to use 3D modeling and digital prototyping technologies to make my projects feasible, allowing me to experiment with shapes and materials, optimize space, and improve the functionality of the design. Technology has become a means to materialize ideas and test solutions before moving on to final production. I applied these skills in Project 1 when creating the first wearable prototype, where initial issues with fit and fastening arose. Feedback received led to adding a screen space and improving the design by replacing the elastic band with a shoelace and shaping the lower part to better fit the shoe, safely housing the custom electronics. Arduino played a crucial role in this process, allowing me to quickly test and implement electronic circuits, such as the color sensor, and manage communication between the various components of the prototype. This approach allowed me to optimize the design, and I am convinced that the use of advanced technologies can make a difference in bringing innovation and precision to design.</p>

The Human-Centered Design course taught me how to conduct interviews with the target audience to better understand their needs and expectations. I applied the skills acquired during Project 1, and this experience taught me how important it is to carefully plan questions to gather useful information for the design process. Additionally, I learned that effective design must address specific needs, and direct user involvement helps improve the design and quality of the final product.</p>
