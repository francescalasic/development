                        <p>I’ve learned how "Business and Entrepreneurship" and "User and Society" are strongly interconnected. Presenting my work was a way to focus on the challenge of capturing users' attention, helping me understand how commercial presentation is key to a product’s success.</p>
                        <p>In the future, I would like to attend economics and marketing courses to expand my knowledge in this area.</p>

                    <div class="competency-details">
                        <p>A good project must not only be aesthetically pleasing but must also respond to user needs. The visual aspect should be closely tied to practicality and function. Good design improves user experience.</p>
                        <p>For Project 1, I designed a children’s game manual using a minimalist graphic style and stylized characters to keep attention on the described actions. Different colors were used in each scene for better visibility and contrast.</p>

                        <p>For example, when designing sustainable packaging, I studied the physical properties of materials. Geometry was key when designing the game box for Project 1 to ensure functionality and aesthetic appeal. Rectangles with rounded edges were used to secure items safely.</p>
                        <p>In designing the wearable prototype, I applied physics to ensure it was ergonomic and safe for children in motion.</p>

                        <p>I used 3D modeling and digital prototyping to develop and refine my designs. For Project 1’s wearable device, I iterated on fit and function, improving usability with a shoelace strap and screen housing. Arduino helped prototype color sensors and communication components.</p>
