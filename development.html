            <p class="section-intro">Here I describe my development journey across five key competency areas</p>

            <div class="competency-grid">
                <!-- Business and Entrepreneurship -->
                <div class="competency-card">
                    <div class="competency-icon">
                        <i class="fas fa-chart-line"></i>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Business & Entrepreneurship</h3>
                    <div class="competency-content">
                        <p>Throughout my journey, I've learned how industrial design can address market needs by creating innovative, sustainable solutions aligned with consumer expectations. I've gained awareness about the importance of data analysis to better guide design choices and make informed decisions.</p>
                        <p>I've explored how analyzing consumer trends and social platforms holds great potential for designers, enabling the creation of targeted products that meet market demands. Understanding the commercial aspect of design is crucial for developing solutions that are not only useful but also marketable and competitive.</p>
                        <p>In the future, I'd like to take economics courses to expand my knowledge in this area.</p>

                <!-- Creativity and Aesthetics -->
                <div class="competency-card">
                    <div class="competency-icon">
                        <i class="fas fa-palette"></i>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Creativity & Aesthetics</h3>
                    <div class="competency-content">
                        <p>My studies have allowed me to develop a deeper understanding of the relationship between creativity and functionality. I've learned that the design approach must balance creativity with attention to user needs, as taught in the Human-Centered Design course.</p>
                        <p>A design shouldn't just be beautiful; it must also be useful and address specific requirements. I've learned to leverage aesthetic principles like chromatic contrast and complementary colors to enhance visibility and visual impact.</p>
                        <p>The aesthetic aspect must be closely connected to an object's functionality and practicality. Reflecting on how good visual design can improve user experience has been fundamental.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <!-- Math, Data and Computing -->
                <div class="competency-card">
                    <div class="competency-icon">
                        <i class="fas fa-calculator"></i>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Math, Data & Computing</h3>
                    <div class="competency-content">
                        <p>Skills in mathematics, physics, and data analysis have been essential during my academic journey, allowing me to improve design choices. My Physics and Calculus courses made me reflect on how creativity must be supported by solid knowledge of physical and mathematical laws.</p>
                        <p>Math and physics not only support design but also enable more conscious and informed decisions, like when choosing materials for sustainable packaging or using geometric principles to create containers.</p>
                        <p>Data analysis has become an essential tool for gathering information and analyzing material performance, enabling the development of practical, aesthetically pleasing, and environmentally respectful projects.</p>

                </div>

                <!-- Technology and Realization -->
                <div class="competency-card">
                    <div class="competency-icon">
                        <i class="fas fa-microchip"></i>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Technology & Realization</h3>
                    <div class="competency-content">
                        <p>Technological skills have been essential for translating design ideas into concrete solutions. I've learned to use 3D modeling and digital prototyping technologies to make my projects feasible.</p>
                        <p>These skills are fundamental for experimenting with forms and materials, optimizing space, and improving design functionality. When designing a prototype wearable device, I used physics principles to ensure it would be ergonomic and functional for children, accounting for movement forces.</p>
                        <p>Technology has become a means to materialize ideas and test solutions before final production. I'm convinced that advanced technologies can make a difference in bringing innovation and precision to design.</p>

                    <h3>User & Society</h3>
                    <div class="competency-content">
                        <p>User focus has been central to my journey. I've learned that good design must start from a deep understanding of user needs and expectations. The user-centered approach taught me that creating a functional product isn't enough - it must also address users' real needs.</p>
                        <p>I conducted interviews with target users to better understand their requirements and expectations. This experience showed me how important it is to carefully plan questions to gather useful information for the design process.</p>
                        <p>Effective design must respond to specific needs, and direct user involvement helps improve both the design process and final product quality.</p>
